# Julian (WIP)

A serverless project that discovers statistics on certain anime in Rust with Jupyter.

## About

This project was built using Jupyter Notebooks and Rust with Cargo. A rust program scrapes anime statistics from various websites and compiles the data into a file that is then read by a python script using Jupyter to generate graphics based on that raw data.

This project is dedicated to my friend Chengming (Julian) Gu who passed away in March of 2021. Julian was a colleague, a co-worker, and an upperclassman. One of his favorite programming languages was Rust, and he was an avid anime enthusiast.
