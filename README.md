# Julian (WIP)

A serverless project that discovers statistics on certain anime in Rust with Jupyter.

## About

This project is dedicated to my friend Chengming (Julian) Gu who passed away in March of 2021. Julian was a colleague, a co-worker, and an upperclassman. We bonded over Rust and anime. I miss you, buddy. Wish we got to talk more.
