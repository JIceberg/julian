# Julian (WIP)

A serverless project that discovers statistics on anime in Rust with Jupyter.

## About

This project was built using Jupyter and Rust. To obtain data, I used the [AniList API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/).

This project is dedicated to my friend Chengming (Julian) Gu who passed away in March of 2021. Julian was a colleague, a co-worker, and an upperclassman. One of his favorite programming languages was Rust, and he was an avid anime enthusiast.
